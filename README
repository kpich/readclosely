This is the source for http://readclosely.com, a somewhat unpolished webapp for facilitating conversations about texts at a fairly fine-grained level.

The site is built in Lift. You can build with maven:
    mvn compile
or, if you want to run it on localhost,
    mvn jetty:run
(though you will need to either (a) have mysql running on localhost and provide a password in Boot.scala; or (b) change Boot.scala to use a different database).

Caveat lector/scriptor: this was, shall we say, a "learning project", so some of the code is pretty hairy.
